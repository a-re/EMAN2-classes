EMAN 2 is an open-source Software for Single Particle Analysis and
Electron Micrograph Analysis. EMAN2 is designed to handle both small,
low-symmetry single particles and large, high symmetry viruses. It
uses more object-oriented technologies for better modular design, has
convenient and flexible interfaces to promote extendibility, emphases
easy and efficient use in Python, and many new capabilities.
