\section {Using Factory Classes}

EMAN has many functions that implement specific algorithms to do image
processing.  These algorithms are relatively independent and a user
chooses which one to use. EMAN2 the following factory classes are defined to
manage these algorithms:

\begin{itemize}

  \item
    \textbf{Processor} (image processor)
  \item
    \textbf{Aligner} (2D/3D image alignment)
  \item
    \textbf{Averager} (averaging a set of images)
  \item
    \textbf{Cmp} (comparing 2 same-size Images)
  \item
    \textbf{Projector} (3D image projection)
  \item
    \textbf{Reconstructor} (3D image reconstruction)

\end{itemize}
